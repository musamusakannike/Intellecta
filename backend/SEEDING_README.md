## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
Make sure your MongoDB is running and the connection string in `.env` is correct:
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### Permission Errors
Ensure your user has write permissions to the database specified in your connection string.

### Memory Issues
If you encounter memory issues with large datasets, try reducing the number of enrollments or reviews in the script.
