## Data Flow

### Profile Data Loading
1. **ProfileScreen** calls `profileService.getProfileData()`
2. **Service** makes API call to `/user/profile-data`
3. **Backend** returns mock data (expandable to real data sources)
4. **Components** render with received data

### Profile Updates
1. **SettingsTab** triggers profile updates
2. **AuthContext.updateUser()** handles the update
3. **Backend** processes the update via existing endpoints
4. **Profile data** refreshes automatically

## Backend Integration

### New Endpoint Added
```javascript
// GET /user/profile-data
// Returns extended profile information including:
// - User stats (XP, courses, streak, etc.)
// - Level information with progress
// - Achievements array with unlock status
// - Certificates with course details
```

### Existing Endpoints Used
- `GET /user/profile` - Basic user information
- `PUT /user/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /user/profile-picture` - Upload profile picture
- `DELETE /user/profile-picture` - Delete profile picture
- `PUT /user/change-password` - Change password
- `DELETE /user/account` - Delete account

## Styling Approach

### Design System
- **Consistent color scheme** using the app's purple theme (#8B5FBF)
- **Glassmorphism cards** with subtle transparency and borders
- **Dynamic colors** that adapt to user level and achievement rarity
- **Proper spacing** using consistent margins and padding
- **Icon integration** using Ionicons for visual consistency

### Responsive Design
- **Flexible layouts** that work across different screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly** button and interaction areas
- **Readable typography** with proper contrast ratios
- **Smooth animations** and transitions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real achievement tracking** based on actual user activity
2. **Social features** for sharing achievements
3. **Profile customization** with themes and backgrounds
4. **Advanced statistics** with charts and graphs
5. **Push notifications** for achievement unlocks
6. **Profile picture upload** with camera/gallery integration

### Backend Expansion
1. **Achievement models** with MongoDB collections
2. **Certificate generation** system
3. **XP calculation** based on course completion
4. **Level progression** algorithms
5. **Statistics aggregation** from user activities

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. The profile page is already integrated into the tab navigation
2. Mock data is provided for development/testing
3. All components are fully typed with TypeScript
4. Error handling and loading states are implemented
5. The design follows the existing app patterns

### For Users
1. **View Profile**: Tap the Profile tab to see your stats and progress
2. **Check Achievements**: Switch to Achievements tab to see unlocked badges
3. **View Certificates**: Browse completed course certificates
4. **Update Settings**: Modify preferences and account settings
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor XP and level progression

## Testing Considerations

### Component Testing
- **ProfileCard** renders correctly with different user levels
- **AchievementsTab** handles locked/unlocked states
- **CertificatesTab** manages empty states gracefully
- **SettingsTab** form interactions work properly

### Integration Testing
- **API calls** succeed and handle errors
- **Navigation** between tabs works smoothly
- **Data updates** reflect immediately in UI
- **Authentication** requirements are enforced

This implementation provides a complete, feature-rich profile page that enhances user engagement through gamification elements while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface that follows the app's design patterns.
